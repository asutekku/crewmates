 * Installs these hooks user-wide: copies the scripts to

 *   bun .claude/hooks/presence/install.ts --force  # re-register hooks too
 *   bun .claude/hooks/presence/install.ts --remove # uninstall
 *
 * WHY USER-WIDE AND NOT PER-PROJECT: hooks are read from the working tree, so a
 * git worktree pinned to an older commit never sees a project-level hook — and
 * worktrees are exactly where parallel agents run. Installing once outside every
 * checkout is what lets a worktree agent join the same roster as the main tree.
 *
 * The scripts are COPIED rather than referenced in place so that deleting or
 * moving a repo cannot break every other project's hooks. Re-run after changing
 * them; the repo copy is the source of truth.
