/**
 * What `msg` PROMISES about delivery, which has to match what happens.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `msg` resolves its target through `liveSessions`, whose
 * horizon is `staleMs` (90 min). That is right for a roster and too generous for
 * a send gate: a recipient silent for an hour and a half still resolved, and the
 * command still printed "Delivered on their next turn."
 *
 * MEASURED, 2026-08-05, over this repo's own 56 directed messages: 40 went to a
 * recipient with no activity for over 90 minutes, 16 to one active within 30,
 * and the 30–90 minute bucket was EMPTY. The confirmation line was wrong for the
 * larger half, which is what these pin.
 *
 * AGAINST THE FUNCTION, NOT THE CLI. The first draft drove `runCli` against a
 * temp db via `PRESENCE_TEST_DB`. It passed alone and took SEVEN tests down in
 * the full sweep: `core/repo.ts` freezes that variable into a module constant at
 * import, and `lineage.test.ts` deletes it in `afterEach`, so one file's harness
 * was redirecting another's database. `deliveryNote` is a pure function of two
 * fields on the recipient row — testing it needs no database at all.

 * and was absent until 2026-08-06.

 * Pinned because nothing else asserts this string — the same gap `audiences.md`

 * quoted "33 verbs" at a table holding 51. Here the claim is "three doors", and
 * the doors are files on disk that can be added to.
