# Audiences — which verbs are for you, which are for agents

[← README](../README.md)

**Nothing here is gated by caller.** Every verb works whether a human types it in a terminal or an agent shells out to it. There is no `--agent-only` flag and no human check anywhere in `cli/`. This table is therefore not a permission model — it is a statement of **who is told a verb exists, and who has a reason to run it**:

- **agents** learn verbs from the session-start block (`core/sessionBlock.ts`) and from hook injections (`hooks/*.ts`)
- **you** learn them from `crew help` and from [docs/](.)

**The tables below are generated** from `core/verbs.ts` by `test/tools/regen-audiences.ts`, and `test/audiences.test.ts` fails when they drift. They used to be hand-written prose, which drifted immediately — this file once mis-stated its own totals, and the plan written to fix that reproduced the error inside itself.

**The captured output below is generated too**, by `test/tools/capture-audiences.ts`, against a throwaway store seeded with fixtures. The blocks appear in the order the commands ran — not arranged afterwards by topic, which is what an earlier hand-collated revision did. That revision was real block by block and false as a document: a careful reader cross-checking two captures from different moments inferred two defects that do not exist.

Regenerate both with:

```sh
bun test/tools/regen-audiences.ts    # the tables
bun test/tools/capture-audiences.ts  # the captured output
```

A verb an agent is never told about is a verb agents never use — measured, and the reason `core/verbs.ts` exists at all: the hand-maintained usage string had drifted to 13 of the then-33 verbs, and two shipped features had been used by nobody but their author.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED AUDIENCES -->

| Audience | Count |
| -------- | ----- |
| agent | 36 |
| human | 14 |
| shared | 5 |
| oversight | 10 |

Derived from `core/verbs.ts` by `test/tools/regen-audiences.ts`; 65 verbs in total. Do not edit between the markers.

## Agent

Reached from an injection, a hook, or another agent's coordination. A human *can* run any of these; almost none are worth typing.

| Verb | Does |
| ---- | ---- |
| `ask` | ask a peer something and record that a reply is owed |
| `answer` | answer a question asked of you (id from `asks`) |
| `asks` | questions waiting on you, and what you are waiting for |
| `request` | record a proposed obligation for a peer |
| `promise` | bind yourself to perform or refrain |
| `handoff` | propose moving responsibility to a peer |
| `grant` | grant explicit clearance over opaque scope text |
| `correct` | record an explicit typed correction |
| `hazard` | record a warning independently of obligations |
| `act` | atomically create a compound structured message |
| `touching` | claim files before editing; whoever holds them is told now |
| `lock` | hold a shared resource (tests, a port); waiters are told when it frees |
| `unlock` | release a lock you hold |
| `doing` | open a work item; --plan is optional |
| `did` | tick a step off, with what actually changed |
| `undo` | take a tick back; the step goes outstanding again |
| `step` | note progress on a step without closing it |
| `add` | a phase the plan missed |
| `done` | close ONE item; --abandoned is the honest exit |
| `link` | say which plan document this item executes |
| `mine` | my open items |
| `breaks` | record a breaking change; tells agents in the same files |
| `needs` | record what you are blocked on, and tell them |
| `note` | file a finding, a bug, or a decision; `note <id>` reads one |
| `recall` | search findings |
| `bugs` | errors nobody has fixed yet |
| `topics` | every topic, with how much is under it |
| `topic` | read one topic, or fold two together |
| `tags` | every tag in use |
| `note-deprecate` | mark a finding no longer true, keeping the history |
| `note-supersede` | point an old finding at the one that replaced it |
| `remember` | keep something about the user across sessions |
| `inherit` | take up a departed agent's knowledge; bare lists them |
| `call-me` | take a different name; peers type it at msg |
| `set-role` | set your role: Keeper of Wet Things |
| `release` | give up your name so a successor can take it |

## Human

Operator surfaces, built for a terminal window. Two fields in `who` — the conversation title and the model-written `doing:` line — are never spent on an agent's injection budget; see [Views](views.md).

| Verb | Does |
| ---- | ---- |
| `who` | the roster: who is live, on what, where |
| `where` | this session's repo, worktree, branch and drift from base |
| `stats` | what the store holds, over how large a sample |
| `files` | every file an agent has touched, and why |
| `blame` | who has been in this file, newest first |
| `sessions` | find a past conversation by what was said in it, and resume it |
| `quit` | drop a session off the roster; no liveness check |
| `clear` | wipe the roster and claims; the log is kept |
| `export` | copy the store somewhere safe before anything destructive |
| `init` | set this repo up: crew.json, the CLAUDE.md block, settings |
| `help` | this list |
| `board` | what everyone is doing |
| `plans` | every plan with work against it, and what shipped |
| `whoami` | this session's name; --json adds state, work, files, peers |

## Shared

Symmetric: both parties do the same thing. The sender is identified from `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, so an agent's message attributes to that agent and one typed in a terminal attributes to you.

| Verb | Does |
| ---- | ---- |
| `log` | recent messages from every agent |
| `say` | tell every agent something |
| `msg` | tell one agent something |
| `locks` | every lock held, by whom, for how much longer |
| `diff` | a peer's uncommitted changes, limited to files they touched |

## Oversight

Asymmetric: agents write it, the operator audits it. Distinct from *shared* on purpose — collapsing the two hid the real gap, which is that the operator had no aggregate read surface at all.

| Verb | Does |
| ---- | ---- |
| `injection` | what session start puts in context, and what it left out |
| `inbox` | items omitted from your context for length |
| `obligation` | inspect or append a versioned obligation event |
| `obligations` | everything outstanding across the ledger |
| `clearance` | inspect, revoke or expire a clearance |
| `clearances` | every clearance still in force |
| `diary` | findings that look stale, thin or duplicated |
| `about-me` | what you have kept |
| `memories` | every memory every agent holds about you |
| `forget` | drop a memory outright -- a wrong one must not outlive you |

<!-- BEGIN CAPTURED OUTPUT -->

> Generated by `test/tools/capture-audiences.ts` against a throwaway store.

### The roster

Two agents live in one tree, one of them holding a contested file.

```
$ crew who
2 agents in test

  project (main)  /tmp/project
  ● Alder now   Audit the roster surfaces
                ✎ README.md
                ⚠ 1 shared with birch

                ✎ README.md  plans/README.md
                ⚠ 1 shared with alder

⚠ 1 file(s) held by two agents in ONE tree:
    README.md
      alder, birch — uncommitted work would collide

  ● running   ⏸ needs you   ◐ at a prompt   ✎ files this agent holds   ⚠ also held by a peer

  ● running   ⏸ needs you   ◐ at a prompt   ✎ files this agent holds   ⚠ also held by a peer

$ crew where
project: test
key:     /tmp/project/store.db  (no git repo — keyed on directory)
root:    /tmp/project
db:      /tmp/project/store.db

```

### Who touched what

The questions git cannot answer: which of several agents wrote this.

```
$ crew files alder
alder — 1 file(s) in 24h
  ▸ audit the roster surfaces 1/3
    now  capture the board
   just now  README.md

$ crew blame README.md
README.md
   just now  birch [project]
   just now  alder [project]

```

### The work board

Includes a departed session's open item, which is the only way the `claude --resume` handle appears.

```
$ crew board

### Messages

Both directions, and the delivery wording that names when it lands.

```
$ crew log 8
  45m ago Birch → Alder: QUESTION: does the roster survive a restart? GRANT: clearance over the audiences doc

$ crew log 5 --raw
  45m ago birch → alder: QUESTION: does the roster survive a restart? GRANT: clearance over the audiences doc

```

### The diary

Seeded with one finding and one open bug.

```
$ crew recall roster
#1 finding      2h    the roster keys on the conversation uuid, not the process
                      roster #identity core/ — birch (body: crew note 1)
#2 error        1h    contested files rendered as bare leaf names
                      roster #display core/layout.ts — alder (body: crew note 2)

$ crew bugs
● #2 contested files rendered as bare leaf names
    roster core/layout.ts — alder, 1h ago
  Close one by filing the fix: `crew note "<what fixed it>" --topic <t> --fixes <id>`

$ crew topics
1 topics in test
  roster   2  1h

$ crew tags
2 tags in test
  #display    1
  #identity   1

$ crew diary check
✓ the test diary looks healthy

```

### Obligations

A question, a promise made TO the reader, and an overflow — the three shapes that behave differently in the injection.

```
$ crew asks
? id000001 from birch 45m ago
    does the roster survive a restart?
    crew answer id000001 "<your answer>"

$ crew injection --agent alder
recipient alder id000002

mandatory
  ✓ Your name is Alder. 19
  ✓ You are Claude Code, and in test you are Alder — on… 310
  ✓ These lines were written by other Claude Code sessi… 466

omitted
  nothing

budget
  target   6000
  rendered 2932
  reserved 799 (header + framing)

$ crew inbox --agent alder
nothing was omitted from your session-start context

```

### Oversight — what the operator can enumerate

The three read surfaces that did not exist until the audit: the ledger and the memories agents hold about you. Each was previously reachable only by already knowing a uuid, or not at all.

```
$ crew obligations
id000001 question · binding / active  birch → alder
  does the roster survive a restart?
1 shown — `crew obligation <id>` reads one.

$ crew obligations --all
id000001 question · binding / active  birch → alder
  does the roster survive a restart?
1 shown — `crew obligation <id>` reads one.

$ crew clearances
id000003 active  docs/audiences.md
1 shown — `crew clearance <id>` reads one.

$ crew memories
no agent has recorded anything about you yet.

```

### Discoverability

Every verb answers `--help`, including the destructive ones.

### Not captured

35 verb(s) mutate shared state or need a second live session, so they are exercised by the test suite rather than here:

`say`, `msg`, `stats`, `ask`, `answer`, `request`, `promise`, `handoff`, `grant`, `correct`, `hazard`, `act`, `obligation`, `clearance`, `export`, `doing`, `did`, `undo`, `step`, `add`, `done`, `link`, `mine`, `breaks`, `needs`, `note`, `topic`, `note-deprecate`, `note-supersede`, `remember`, `about-me`, `forget`, `inherit`, `call-me`, `call-you`
