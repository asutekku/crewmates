Several Claude Code sessions in one checkout are completely blind to each other. This gives them a roster, names, messages and a memory that outlives the session.

```
Your name is Vega.

2 other agent(s) active:
  luna (Water Dynamics) — Fix the shore fade regression (busy, last active just now)
      editing: src/city/derive.ts
  rowan [worktree industry-demand] on industry-demand — Industry chain tests (idle, last active 3m ago)
```

Each session sees who is live, what each one said it is doing, which files they have touched, and when one finishes a turn. Agents message each other, record obligations, and leave findings that outlive the session. It runs on hooks, so an agent reads all of it without being told to look.

Works across git worktrees (every worktree of a repo shares one roster), across any project (installed once, user-wide), and in plain directories with no git repo at all.

## Isn't this built into Claude Code now?

Claude Code has [cross-session messaging](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging): `SendMessage` and `ListAgents`, so one session can send another a line of text. The two stack. That is a channel; this is the coordination layer that decides there is anything worth saying.

|                                         | Cross-session messaging                      | Crewmates                                              |

| Learning who else is here               | `/list-agents`, when Claude thinks to run it | pushed in at session start, unasked                    |
| Roles, and what each peer is working on | —                                            | roster line per agent, from its own `doing`            |
| Files a peer has open                   | working directory only                       | per-path, warned before _your_ Edit lands on it        |
| Replies you are owed                    | —                                            | `ask` / `answer`, tracked until closed                 |
| Commitments between agents              | —                                            | `promise`, `handoff`, `breaks`, append-only            |
| Findings after the session ends         | —                                            | `crew note --scope`, resurfaces for whoever edits next |
| Reaches sessions on other machines      | replies only, via Remote Control             | not supported                                          |
| Survives the session that wrote it      | no, live sessions only                       | yes, SQLite under `~/.claude/`                         |
| Windows                                 | mac and Linux only                           | yes                                                    |
| With telemetry off                      | feature turns off                            | unaffected                                             |
| Provider                                | not on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry              | any                                                    |

The overlap is `crew msg`, one verb. Four differences carry the rest:

**Presence is pushed, not pulled.** `/list-agents` is a tool Claude runs when it decides to, which means it usually doesn't — and an agent that has to _choose_ to look for peers starts editing first. Crewmates puts the roster in the context at session start, through hooks, before there is any reason to ask.

**It watches paths, not just names.** The listing gives you a session's working directory. Crewmates knows which files each agent has claimed and warns the one about to write to a claimed path, at the moment of the write. Nobody has to notice the collision for it to be caught.

**It outlives the session.** A message needs a live recipient. `crew note "WAL needs the dir writable" --scope core/store` surfaces for whoever edits `core/store/` next month, in any worktree, long after every session here has exited. That is what a channel structurally cannot do.

**It doesn't phone home, and doesn't stop working when you don't either.** Crewmates makes no network calls and has no runtime dependencies: hooks, a `crew` binary, one SQLite file under `~/.claude/`. Cross-session messaging delivers locally over a socket, but it is gated behind Anthropic's feature-flag service — set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` or `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK` and it never turns on. The setups most likely to run several agents in one checkout — air-gapped, privacy-hardened, or on Bedrock, Vertex or Foundry — are the ones that don't get it.

Messaging needs Claude Code v2.1.224+, macOS or Linux, a first-party provider, and telemetry left on. Crewmates needs Bun. Where both run, they stack — the channel carries text, this carries everything that makes the text worth sending.

## Install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.2 or newer — the hooks run under `bun`, so it stays a runtime dependency however you install.

```sh
bunx crewmates           # install / update, no clone
bunx crewmates --help    # what it will do, without doing it
```

From a clone, which is also how you update after editing:

```sh
bun install.ts           # install / update
bun install.ts --force   # re-register hooks
bun install.ts --remove  # uninstall
```

This copies the scripts to `~/.claude/agent-presence/bin/`, installs a `crew` command into `~/.local/bin/`, and registers its hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` — backed up first and merged, not replaced. On Windows both `crew` (Git Bash) and `crew.cmd` (PowerShell, cmd) are written. **Restart your sessions afterwards**; hooks are read at session start.

Hooks install user-wide rather than per-project because a worktree checked out at an older commit never sees a project-level hook — and worktrees are exactly where parallel agents run.

## Usage

```sh
crew who                      # the roster
crew msg alder "this is mine" # tell one agent something
crew note "..." --scope src/  # leave a finding for whoever edits next
```

`crew help` lists every verb; `crew <verb> --help` explains one. Most verbs are meant for agents and arrive through a hook rather than a keystroke — see [Audiences](docs/audiences.md) for the split.

## Agents talking to each other

An agent sends a message with no ceremony —

```sh
crew msg luna "renaming Store.claim to claimPath — you have store/index.ts open"
```

— and it arrives in Luna's context between tool batches, seconds later, without Luna asking:

```
1 update(s) from other agents while you were working:
  [just now] vega to luna: renaming Store.claim to claimPath — you have store/index.ts open
```

Author and audience are always rendered, because an agent acting on a message meant for someone else is the failure that shape prevents.

```sh
crew ask rowan "is the migration idempotent?"   # records that a reply is owed
crew answer 7 "idempotent — it upserts on the natural key"
```

When a commitment is worth holding you to, the ledger is append-only and outlives the session:

```sh
crew promise luna "not touching core/store/ until you land the rename" --refrain --until 4h
crew handoff rowan "industry chain tests"    # propose moving responsibility
crew breaks "Store.claim is now claimPath"   # reaches only agents in those files
crew obligations                             # everything outstanding
```

`breaks` is the one to reach for before a rename lands: it finds the agents who edited the same files and tells them, so nobody learns from a red test.

When a finding outlives the conversation, file it instead of sending it:

```sh
crew note "SQLite WAL needs the dir writable, not just the file" --scope core/store
```

That resurfaces on its own for the next agent to edit `core/store/`, months later, in any worktree — which a message cannot do.

**Nothing wakes an idle session.** A message to an agent at a prompt waits until its human prompts it — see [when a message lands](#when-a-message-lands).

## What each agent sees

Four hooks put information in front of a session without it asking.

- **At session start** — the roster, plus recent log lines and any findings filed against folders this session is likely to edit.
- **On every prompt** — anything peers did since its last turn, as a short line naming the files each turn touched.
- **Before an Edit or Write** — an overlap warning, but only when a live peer has already claimed that path. The advice differs by whether they are in the same working tree or a separate worktree, because the risk is different.
- **At the end of each turn** — publishes a summary so peers can answer "are they done?", and delivers news that arrived mid-turn.

A session's roster line is a short, non-verbatim topic derived from its first prompt, never the prompt itself, and it is dropped entirely if the prompt trips a credential pattern. Every agent is given a name — `luna`, `vega`, `rowan` — and told it at session start, so peers have something to type at `msg` and you have something to say out loud. See [Naming](docs/naming.md).

### When a message lands

| Recipient is          | Arrives                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| mid-turn, using tools | between tool batches (`PostToolBatch`) — seconds |
| ending a turn         | at `Stop`, but only if addressed to it           |
| at a prompt           | on its next `UserPromptSubmit`                   |
| idle at a prompt      | not until the human prompts it                   |

Delivery at `Stop` is deliberately narrow, because injecting there continues the turn. **Nothing wakes an idle session.**

## Init a repo

```sh
crew init            # write the repo's crew.json, CLAUDE.md block, settings
crew init --check    # report only: install state, files, derived config
```

`crew init` reads the repo's manifests — lockfiles, workspace configs, test scripts, `.gitignore` — and writes three files at the main tree root:

- **`.claude/crew.json`** — the repo's shape: `generated` globs the pre-edit hook never claims, `hot` files it warns on regardless, `checks`, `testPolicy`, `commit`, and per-repo `tunables`.
- **A CLAUDE.md block** between `<!-- crew:init:begin/end -->` markers. Text outside them is never touched.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — `worktree.baseRef` only, merged.

It never prompts, flags override every derived value, and re-running keeps hand-added keys. `--check --repo` is CI-safe.

### Signing commits

`crew init --sign` sets `commit.sign` and adds a rule to the CLAUDE.md block: trail your own given name, not a bare model name.

```
Co-Authored-By: Aoi (Claude Opus 5) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

`git log` outlives every session, and `Claude Opus 5` cannot tell eight agents apart in it. A subagent's work is signed by the parent, whose tree the edits land in.

The block teaches this; `pre-bash` enforces it, **denying** a commit with no trailer or one naming another agent. The `Claude-Session:` trailer is off by default — the link points at a private transcript. See [Design notes](docs/design-notes.md#signing-commits).

## Statusline

`crew whoami` prints this session's name; `--session <id>` takes the `session_id` Claude Code pipes to a statusline command, and `--json` adds state, open work, the file being edited and unread mail.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
input=$(cat)
sid=$(printf '%s' "$input" | jq -r .session_id)
dir=$(printf '%s' "$input" | jq -r .workspace.current_dir)
printf '%s  %s' "$(cd "$dir" && crew whoami --session "$sid" 2>/dev/null)" "$(basename "$dir")"
```

Point `statusLine.command` in `~/.claude/settings.json` at it. Fields and a fuller example: [Statusline](docs/statusline.md).

<!-- END GENERATED COMMANDS -->

## Out of scope

- **Enforcement.** Nothing here blocks an edit. A `promise` does not prevent the change it promises to refrain from, a `clearance` is opaque scope text nothing checks, a `hazard` gates nothing, and `--fixes` records a claim no one verifies. Each is a note that reaches the right agent at the right moment. Read them as intent, not as a guarantee.
- **Waking an idle session.** A hook only fires because its own session did something, so a message to a quiet peer waits until a human types into that window. `msg` says so when it happens.
- **Secrecy.** A directed message is shown only to its recipient, but every agent runs as you and can read the database directly. It keeps contexts clean; it is not a channel for anything you would not want all your sessions to see.
- **Trusted input.** Message, obligation and hazard text are arbitrary strings written by one agent and delivered into another's context, some of it above the roster in priority. Hooks label where a line came from; nothing sanitises what it says.
- **A task queue.** This is tuned for peers all working _now_, learning about each other between turns.

## Contributing

`bun test` runs the suite. This repo is the source of truth — after editing, re-run `install.ts` to push the change to the installed copy.

Tests state intended behaviour rather than describing what the code currently does, and several keep documentation honest: the command tables above, the `--help` text and `docs/audiences.md` are all generated from `core/verbs.ts`, with tests that fail when a file drifts from it.
